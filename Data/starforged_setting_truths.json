          "Description": "The anomaly traveled at incredible speeds, many times faster than light itself, and snuffed out the stars around us before we realized it was coming. Few of us survived as we made our way to this new galaxy. Here in the Forge, the stars are still aflame. We cling to their warmth like weary travelers huddled around a campfire. We suspect the Sun Plague was caused by:",

          "Summary": "Everything fell apart in an age of chaos.",

          "Description": "We found the iron pillar on our homeworld's moon. A map on the surface of this ancient relic described the location of the Forge. Was it an invitation or a warning? When our fleets set off on the ponderous Exodus to a new home outside our galaxy, they marked the Forge as their destination.",
          "Quest": "You are tormented by dreams of a lost Exodus ship. You see it floating in a great emptiness. Thousands of refugees, still held in stasis, call to you in their unending sleep."
        },
        {
          "Summary": "We assembled a ragtag fleet of ships powered by experimental technologies. The journey to the Forge required only a few years, but many ships did not survive the crossing.",
          "Description": "With its dense star systems and turbulent storms of gaseous energies, the Forge shone like a lighthouse at the edge of a barren shore. When the time came to make our escape, we harnessed experimental and dangerous superluminal drives to send our ships to that distant destination.",
          "Quest": "A malfunctioning drive sent one of the refugee ships through both space and time. Centuries later, they have finally arrived. For them, only weeks have passed. Why are these people mistrusted? What will you do to find them a home?"

          "Description": "At our moment of greatest need, the titanic iron-gray gates materialized simultaneously in orbit around our homeworld and outposts. With no other option, our Exodus fleets entered the gates and crossed over into the Forge. The devices we emerged from on this side lie dormant; despite years of study, we've found no way to wake them.",
          "Quest": "An explorer brings news. They've located an active gate in the depths of the Forge. Why do you swear to travel there? Which power or foe seeks to take control of the gate?"

          "Quest": "A settlement on an icebound planet is found abandoned. There is no sign of an attack. No bodies. Their ships and vehicles sit idle. The people are simply gone. Vanished. What is your connection to this place?"

          "Summary": "Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans.",
          "Description": "We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common.",
          "Quest": "A forsaken people, sworn to no clan, live on an orbital station. A recent illness left many sick or dead. Supplies are urgently needed. Why were these people exiled, and why do you swear to give them aid? Which clan stands against you?"
        },
        {
          "Summary": "We have made our mark in this galaxy, but the energy storms we call balefires threaten to undo that progress, leaving our communities isolated and vulnerable.",
          "Description": "Starships navigate along bustling trade routes between settlements. We've built burgeoning outposts on the fringes of known sectors, and bold spacers chart new paths into unexplored domains. But this hard-earned success is threatened by the chaotic balefires, intense energy anomalies which cut off trade routes and threaten entire planets.",
          "Quest": "A balefire expands toward a remote deep-space settlement. Can a rescue fleet be marshaled in time to transport the inhabitants of the station to safety? What foe stands in the way?"

      "Character": "If vows to a leader or organization are a key aspect of your character, you might be [BANNERSWORN].

          "Summary": "We swear vows upon the iron remnants of ships that carried our people to the Forge.",
          "Description": "Many of our outposts were built from the iron bones of the Exodus ships. Fragments of the ships were also given to survivors as a remembrance, passed from one generation to the next. Today, we swear vows upon the iron shards to honor the sacrifice of our forebears, the essence of the places left behind, and the souls of the great ships that carried us here.",
          "Quest": "The iron shard you carry is a small piece of the outer hull of an Exodus ship. The navigational chart inscribed on its surface only reveals itself when exposed to the light of a specific star. Who passed this relic to you? Where is the map purported to lead, and why are you sworn to follow it? Who seeks to claim the map for themselves?"
        },
        {
          "Summary": "We wield iron blades, and bind our honor to them.",
          "Description": "Aboard a ship, where stray gunfire can destroy fragile equipment or pierce a hull, the brutal practicality of a sword makes it a useful weapon. A few also favor the silent efficiency of a blade for infiltration or espionage. Most importantly, when we swear a vow upon a sword, we bind our commitment to the iron. If we forsake a vow, that iron must be abandoned. To be without a blade is to be disgraced.",
          "Quest": "You vow to forge a new sword from the iron of an important object or artifact. What is it, and why is it meaningful to you? Who protects it?"
        },
        {
          "Summary": "Iron totems represent our connection to the universe.",
          "Description": "In the early days of our people, an iron vow was a promise to ancient gods. Today, we recognize iron as a fundamental element of the universe. It is in the stars. It is in the mantle and core of the worlds we make our home. We craft it into the simplest of tools and mightiest of starships. It is even in our blood. We carry iron totems and swear vows upon them to honor our legacy and show a commitment to things larger than ourselves.",
          "Quest": "An heirloom iron token of special significance has been stolen. What power or authority is bound to this relic? Who has taken it?"
        }
      ],
      "Character": "What do you swear vows upon? Why is this object meaningful to you? If your background or personality emphasizes the strength of your iron vows, you might be [HONORBOUND]."

    "Laws": {
      "Truths": [
        {
          "Summary": "Much of the settled domains are a lawless frontier. Criminal factions and corrupt leaders often hold sway.",
          "Description": "Powers rise and fall in the Forge, so any authority is fleeting. In the end, we must fend for ourselves. A few communities are bastions of successful autonomy, but many are corrupted or preyed upon by petty despots, criminals, and raiders.",
          "Quest": "In the upper atmosphere of a gas giant, transport vehicles carry valuable and volatile fuel from the processing plant to a heavily guarded storage depot. The notorious leader of a criminal organization needs this fuel, and gives you the schedule for the transports. What leverage does this person hold over you? How will you undertake this heist?"
        },
        {
          "Summary": "Laws and governance vary across settled domains, but bounty hunters are given wide latitude to pursue their contracts. Their authority is almost universally recognized, and supersedes local laws.",
          "Description": "Through tradition and influence, the powerful Hunters Guild is given free reign to track and capture fugitives in most settled places. Only the foolish stand between a determined bounty hunter and their target.",
          "Quest": "A famed bounty hunter needs your help tracking down their quarry. What is your relationship to the fugitive? Do you swear to aid the hunter, or the target?"
        },
        {
          "Summary": "Our communities are bound under the terms of the Covenant, a charter established after the Exodus. The organization called the Keepers is sworn to uphold those laws.",
          "Description": "Most settlements are still governed under the Covenant and yield to the authority of the Keepers. But a few view the Covenant as a dogmatic, impractical, and unjust relic of our past; in those places, the Keepers find no welcome.",
          "Quest": "A Keeper abuses their authority to take control of a settlement, and rules with an iron fist. What do they seek to gain there?"
        }
      ],
      "Character": "If you chase down outlaws, you might be a [BOUNTY HUNTER]. If you are on the run yourself, you might be a [FUGITIVE].

      "Truths": [
        {
          "Summary": "Our gods failed us. We left them behind.",
          "Description": "The Exodus was a tipping point. The gods offered no help to the billions who died in the cataclysm, and spirituality has little meaning in the Forge. Most now see religion as a useless relic of our past. But the search for meaning continues, and many are all-too-willing to follow a charismatic leader who claims to offer a better way.",
          "Quest": "A charismatic leader claims to have harnessed a technology which offers new hope to the people of the Forge. What is this innovation? What is your relationship to this person or their followers? What grave danger do they pose?"
        },
        {
          "Summary": "Our faith is as diverse as our people.",
          "Description": "Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.",
          "Quest": "A cult seeks to take control of a site reputed to hold a Primordial artifact. What holy object do they seek? Why are you sworn to stop them?"
        },
        {
          "Summary": "Three dominant religious orders, the Triumvirate, battle for influence and power within the Forge.",
          "Description": "Our communities are often sworn to serve one of the three doctrines of the Triumvirate. For many, faith offers purpose and meaning. But it also divides us. Throughout our short history in the Forge, the leaders of the Triumvirate have pitted us against each other. For this reason, some are apostates who disavow these religions and follow a different path.",
          "Quest": "You bear the mark of one of the gods of the Triumvirate. What is it? Priests declare this as a sign you are chosen to fulfill a destiny. Do you accept this fate, and swear to see it through, or are you determined to see it undone? What force opposes you?"

          "Summary": "Magic does not exist.",
          "Description": "Some look to superstition and age-old traditions as comfort in this unforgiving galaxy. But that is foolishness. What some call magic is simply a product of technologies or natural forces we aren't yet equipped to understand.",
          "Quest": "An ancient technological relic unleashes a power indistinguishable from magic. What is the origin of this artifact? What ability does it grant? Are you sworn to protect or destroy it?"

          "Summary": "Unnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and science are two sides of the same coin.",
          "Description": "Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the Forge's energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are respected and feared in equal measure.",
          "Quest": "Someone you love has been corrupted by the powers of the Forge. Why did they fall into darkness? Where are they now? Do you seek to save them or defeat them?"

          "Summary": "Much was lost when we came to the Forge. It is a dark age.",
          "Description": "The knowledge that remains is a commodity as valuable as the rarest resource. Information is collected, hoarded, and jealously guarded. Ships and outposts endure long periods of isolation, and rumors or disinformation are used to gain advantage or undermine foes.",
          "Quest": "An insurgent organization seeks to make knowledge available to all. To that end, they ask your aid in stealing important data from an outpost belonging to a corrupt organization. What information is held there? Why is it also important to you?"

          "Description": "Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost is impossible due to the chaotic energies of the Forge. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by the Heralds, sworn to see that data to its destination.",
          "Quest": "You discover a crippled Herald ship. The pilot, carrying a critical and time-sensitive message, is dead. Where was the message bound, and why do you swear to see it to its destination?"

          "Summary": "In settled domains, a network of data hubs called the Weave allow near-instantaneous communication and data-sharing between ships and outposts.",
          "Description": "Because of their importance, the Weave hubs are often targets for sabotage, and communication blackouts are not uncommon. Beyond the most populous sectors, travelers and outposts are still commonly isolated and entirely off the grid.",
          "Quest": "After years of isolation, the launch of a new data hub will connect several outposts to the Weave. But a person or faction seeks to stop it. What do they hope to gain by keeping those settlements in the dark? Why are you sworn to stop them?"

          "Description": "Our computers are limited to simple digital systems and the most basic machine intelligence. This is because: [Suboracle]. The Adepts serve in place of those advanced systems.

Those back on the salvage ship heard horrible screams over the radio.
