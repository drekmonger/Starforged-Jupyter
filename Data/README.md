# Dataforged

Starforged playtest rules data for use in community tools, because there's no use in duplicating labour on the data entry.

Currently just JSON and a markdown doc of formatted moves, other formats TBA.

## Current Version/Sources

  * **Oracles-Preview-091420**
  * **Assets-Singles-122020**
  * **Moves-Reference-122020** (move text, move-related oracles)
  * **Launching-Your-Campaign-112220** (setting Truth oracles, character creation prompt oracles)

## Oracle Tables

Square brackets in an oracle result represent a reference to another oracle, or a special result like "roll twice".

## A Note on Markdown

I've used markdown to retain the formatting of the original rules text where possible. There's no standard markdown for underlining (which is typically reserved for links), so I've opted to use `__text__` to represent underlined text (which is what Discord uses), and `**text**` for bold text. Most MD implementations (including Github's) interpret `__text__` as bolded text, though.

Thanks to [XenotropicDev](https://github.com/XenotropicDev) for letting me use the data from [TheOracle](https://github.com/XenotropicDev/TheOracle) (a Discord bot for use with Ironsworn and Starforged) as a starting point.
